# Deterministic preparation of optical squeezed cat states
This GitHub repository contains MATLAB code to perform simulations of the deterministic preparation of optical squeezed cat states.
To use the code, simply run the 'run_me.m' file in MATLAB. The required functions are included.
The code performs simulations of scheme I and scheme II and plots the output Wigner functions.
For more details, see the manuscript.
